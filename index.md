OPS-CLC is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship project exploring **light–matter interaction in chiral soft-matter systems**. The action investigated whether **plane-wave, linearly polarised light** can induce **handedness-dependent optomechanical responses** in cholesteric liquid-crystal (CLC) micro-objects, with the long-term motivation of developing contact-free chiral discrimination and sorting strategies.
